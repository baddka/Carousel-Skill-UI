# ðŸŽ  Unity Carousel Skill UI Effect

A polished, lightweight **skill-selection carousel** for Unity â€” ideal for RPGs, action games, or any UI that needs a rotating, focused selection of abilities. Smooth depth, scale and opacity transitions make the selected skill pop while off-center skills feel distant.
